# **Project Description**
For this project my task was to build a 5 question quiz with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. When users click the start quiz button the script initializes the quiz and sets a countdown timer to 75 seconds. 10 seconds are subtracted for each incorrect answer. The user's score is determined by the amount of time remaining left on the timer upon completion of the quiz. Users will then be asked to submit their initials to be associated with their high score. Afterwards a list of locally stored high scores are displayed with an option to clear high scores or retry the quiz.
